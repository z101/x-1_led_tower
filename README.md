# x-1_led_tower
This is an electronic LED sculpture project, stylized as some generic telecommunication tower and inspired by @mohitbhoite cool works.
The project will be break down to next parts:
1. **Electronic circuit**. Developed in KiCAD. Circuit from Frank Sichla's book. SPICE models for simulation taken from Internet
2. **3D model**. Developed in FreeCAD
3. **Assembly**. The most interesting part - building sculpture itself

## KiCAD circuit version 1

## KiCAD circuit SPICE flash spike simulation version 1

## FreeCAD 3D prototype version 1

## Initial conditions changed
Due to a number of reasons, I can't solder at home yet. Therefore, I decided to redesign the tower project for assembly via crimping.

## FreeCAD 3D prototype version 2

## FreeCAD 3D prototype version 2 assembly (failed)
Assembling the sculpture neatly using the blueprints of v2 turned out to be too difficult for me. As a result, I abandoned v2 and decided to remake it into v3 - lightweight and simplified.
